    "## 1. Why Playwright\n",
    "- So far, we have learned how to scrape **static** HTML pages using **Requests + BeautifulSoup**\n",
    "- However, if the web content relies on **javascript or AJAX** to build the content, this combination does not work\n",
    "  - Elements in a web page loaded **asynchronously**\n",
    "     * while requests.get(url) can only return the initial content\n",
    "     * you may need to wait for a while to get web content fully loaded\n",
    "  - You need to **interact with the page** to get some content loaded, e.g.\n",
    "     * scroll down to load more\n",
    "     * click a button like \"more\"\n",
    "     * fill a form\n",

    "- Playwright is a **Web automation framework** that can automate web browser interactions. It can navigate to URLs, enter text, click buttons, extract text, etc. The most exciting feature of Playwright is that it can work with multiple pages at the same time, without getting blocked or having to wait for operations to complete in any of them. \n",
    "- It supports **asychronous** functions, which can work with multiple pages at the same time, without getting blocked or having to wait for operations to complete in any of them.\n",
    "- It supports most browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge using Chromium, Firefox and Safari with a single web driver (Selenium has a separate web driver for each browsser).\n",
    "- Playwright is really useful when you have to perform action on a website such as:\n",
    "  - clicking on buttons\n",
    "  - filling forms\n",
    "  - scrolling\n",
    "  - taking a screenshot\n",
